            <h2>Mistfits</h2>

            <p>Setting yourself apart is the most daunting challenge of every creative's journey.</p>

            <p>This is because as a beginner, you do not have the right amount of experience, network and influence to make yourself a distinct figure in your niche.</p>

            <p> It is often very easy to be overlooked by clients and other professionals when you do not have a distinct offer that makes you stand out from the rest of the crowd.</p>

            <p>Every creative however, has an innate ability to stand out.</p>

            <p>Through <b>unhindered creativity and authenticity</b>, we can all posses this supernatural gift and reap from the benefits of being <i>misfits</i>.</p>

            <h2>The 'Mirage'</h2>
            <p>On a hot sunny day, driving on the tarmac, you happen to see a nice pool of water floating at a distance.</p>

            <p>As a child, I would imagine how cool it would feel for the car to just cruise over it and just splash the water, and quench the thirst of the tires.</p>

            <p>But on reaching the exact spot, with my expectations high, everything's silent, like where did the pool of water go?</p>

            <p>Another seems to appear at a distance, same excitement, same disappointment.</p>

            <p>Likewise, growing up, we experience the same thing, where, an idea sparks up in your mind, you become excited, anxious and energized, you jump into action but soon enough your passion and interest fade away as quick as it goes.</p>

            <p>Before we realize it, many ideas have crossed our minds, however none of them has ever materialized and actually reached the fruition level we desire.</p>

            <p>
                <b>Why is this so?</b>
                Is it because we are not good enough? or is it because we are not creative enough?
            </p>

            <p>
                For all my life, that is what I believed. But in reality, being creative has nothing to do with turning your ideas into reality. Being does not play a role either. 
            </p>

            <p>
                To make your ideas a reality, only requires a simple shift in the way you view this whole process. It does not involve reading a million books, or attending a thousand seminars. It only requires you to understand the <b>learning process</b>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        A process that I intend to share with you through this article.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        One that school teachers have neglected for ages, and one that has been the secret to the success of many great minds.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>You may be wondering, <i>then why is it that many people do not know of this process?</i></p>

            <p>
                The reason is because most people neglect the idea behind its concept, because the idea is so simple and basic that it often  occurs as trivial to most people, hence easily overlooked.
            </p>

            <p> Through this article I will <i>explain & demonstrate</i> to you how this process works.</p>
