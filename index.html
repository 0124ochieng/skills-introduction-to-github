        <p>
            Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage project history. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools. Together, Git and GitHub streamline the development workflow, making it easier to work on projects both individually and in teams.
