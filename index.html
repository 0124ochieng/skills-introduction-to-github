            <h2>Mistfits</h2>

            <p>Setting yourself apart is the most daunting challenge of every creative's journey.</p>

            <p>This is because as a beginner, you do not have the right amount of experience, network and influence to make yourself a distinct figure in your niche.</p>

            <p> It is often very easy to be overlooked by clients and other professionals when you do not have a distinct offer that makes you stand out from the rest of the crowd.</p>

            <p>Every creative however, has an innate ability to stand out.</p>

            <p>Through <b>unhindered creativity and authenticity</b>, we can all posses this supernatural gift and reap from the benefits of being <i>misfits</i>.</p>

            <h2>The 'Mirage'</h2>
            <p>On a hot sunny day, driving on the tarmac, you happen to see a nice pool of water floating at a distance.</p>

            <p>As a child, I would imagine how cool it would feel for the car to just cruise over it and just splash the water, and quench the thirst of the tires.</p>

            <p>But on reaching the exact spot, with my expectations high, everything's silent, like where did the pool of water go?</p>

            <p>Another seems to appear at a distance, same excitement, same disappointment.</p>

            <p>Likewise, growing up, we experience the same thing, where, an idea sparks up in your mind, you become excited, anxious and energized, you jump into action but soon enough your passion and interest fade away as quick as it goes.</p>

            <p>Before we realize it, many ideas have crossed our minds, however none of them has ever materialized and actually reached the fruition level we desire.</p>
